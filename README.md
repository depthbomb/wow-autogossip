_AutoGossip_ is a simple addon that automates picking the appropriate NPC gossip options to either progress a quest or to access features of the NPC such as the mail in the cast of Katy Stampwhistle. It even works for gossips that have multiple pages!

This addon is fully functional, however it is not fully "complete"; there are still many NPCs that need to be handled. I plan to add these NPCs as frequently as I can, but if I miss any or have any suggestions then do let me know!

This is my first attempt at a WoW addon so I'm still learning!
