_AutoGossip_ is a simple addon that automates picking the appropriate NPC gossip options to either progress a quest or to access features of the NPC such as the mail in the case of Katy Stampwhistle. It even works for gossips that have multiple pages!

This addon is fully functional, however it is not fully "complete"; there are still many NPCs that need to be handled. I plan to add these NPCs as frequently as I can, but if I miss any or have any suggestions then do let me know!

There are two modifier keys that can be held down before talking to an NPC that this addon automates:

- `SHIFT` prevents gossip automation
- `ALT` forces gossip automation in cases where it would be stopped, such as if the NPC has available quests

**NOTE** Do not use this addon if you like to take your time and/or read NPC dialogue as this will instantly choose the best option(s) to progress things. If you do want to continue using this addon but want to not automatically choose an option, then hold `SHIFT` before talking to an NPC.

## Plugins

Installing AutoGossip now also includes optional plugins that are enabled automatically in the addon menu. For example, NPC automation in _The War Within_ is its own plugin so you may disable that addon to disable automation.

This is my first attempt at a WoW addon so I'm still learning!
