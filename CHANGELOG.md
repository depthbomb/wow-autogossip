## 2024.09.02

This update splits _AutoGossip_ into multiple addons that are included automatically. The main addon is now called _AutoGossip Core_ and will provide automation for all content prior to _The War Within_ with _The War Within_ content being split into a "plugin" addon. The plugin addon does nothing on its own and requires the core addon to be enabled. You can disable this plugin addon to "opt out" of NPC automation in _The War Within_ content.
